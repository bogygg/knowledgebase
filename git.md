# git

Cloning a repository:
```bash
git clone [url]
```

After changing or adding to the code in our local repository(code), in order for it to save in the remote repository we have to do a commit and push, this is done in 3 steps:
1. Add a commit
```bash
git add [path/file name]
```
2. Create a commit after adding all files needed and create a message for it 
```bash
git commit -m [message of commit]
```
3. Push will save the commit to the remote depository
```bash
git push
```
